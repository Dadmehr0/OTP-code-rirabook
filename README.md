# Notes

  💢 Hacking and security testing is illegal without the permission of the site owners
    
# efficient

  ❓ Using Python, we can easily test the otp code
  
  ❓ The program sends the otp code to the mobile number with the specific data and urls of the site --
      otp subtracted the code from 999999 numbers one by one and tested it
      
  ❓ I have two types of otp code testers, one does this one by one and the other one tests two codes per second
  
# security issues

  ⚠ Due to low security, it tests the otp code as long as you want and does not block IPs
